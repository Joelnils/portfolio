# Matplan Development Log

## Session: September 14, 2025

### Overview
This was a comprehensive development session where we continued from a previous conversation context. We worked on multiple major features for the Matplan (nutrition calculator) project, from recipe import functionality to UI improvements and content expansion.

### Complete Session Accomplishments

#### 1. Recipe Import System Implementation
- **Problem**: Recipe cards from static pages weren't importing ingredients into the calculator
- **Solution**: Implemented URL parameter-based import system
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `?import=recipe-id` URL parameter handling in `src/App.jsx`
  - Created `importMealPlan()` function to automatically load recipe ingredients
  - Fixed navigation links in static pages to use correct paths
  - Added automatic meal count setting based on recipe servings
- **Result**: Users can now click "üç± Anv√§nd i kalkylatorn" and get ingredients automatically loaded

#### 2. Button Alignment & Navigation Fixes
- **Problem**: Recipe card buttons were misaligned and linking to wrong pages
- **Solution**: Fixed CSS styling and navigation paths
- **Changes**:
  - Changed button display from `inline-block` to `block` with proper centering
  - Updated hrefs from `../` to `../../` for correct calculator navigation
  - Fixed button positioning in recipe cards

#### 3. Complete Ingredient Display
- **Problem**: Recipe cards only showed partial ingredient lists (first 3-4 items)
- **Solution**: Removed ingredient limits and height restrictions
- **Implementation**: Updated static page generation to show all ingredients without truncation
- **Result**: Users can see complete shopping lists before importing

#### 4. Instruction Text Updates
- **Problem**: Outdated text mentioned clicking "Inspiration" instead of recipe buttons
- **Solution**: Updated instruction text to accurately describe current functionality
- **Location**: Updated text in static page templates

#### 5. Category Navigation System
- **Request**: User wanted easier navigation between recipe categories
- **Implementation**:
  - First added navbar below summary bar
  - Then moved to header integration for cleaner design
  - Added translucent glass-effect navigation buttons in hero section
  - Categories: Inspiration, Budget, Fitness, Familj, LCHF, Vegetariskt, Snabbt
- **Result**: Professional navigation integrated into header design

#### 6. Calculator Layout Reorganization
- **Problem**: Poor UX flow in empty state with vertical stacking
- **Solution**: Reorganized to side-by-side layout for better space usage
- **Changes**:

- **Distribution**: 2 additional recipes per category for better variety
- **Focus**: Realistic portions, accurate cost estimates, complete ingredient lists

#### 8. Meal Type Organization System
- **Problem**: Recipe cards were not organized by meal time, making it hard for users to find appropriate recipes for different parts of the day
- **Solution**: Implemented meal type categorization system
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `mealType` arrays to all 25 recipes in `src/data/mealPlans.js`
  - Created grouping functions in `scripts/generateCategoryPages.js`
  - Added beautiful meal type sections with icons (üåÖ Frukost, ü•™ Lunch, üçΩÔ∏è Middag, üçé Mellanm√•l)
  - Each section shows recipe count and groups recipes logically
- **Result**: Category pages now show organized sections like "üåÖ Frukost (2 recept)" with clear visual separation

#### 2. New Recipe Addition: Kanelbulle-ugnsgr√∂t
- **Request**: User wanted to add a cinnamon roll baked oatmeal breakfast recipe
- **Implementation**:
  - Added complete recipe to budget category with breakfast meal type
  - 6 portions, realistic cost estimation (36 kr total, ~6 kr/portion)

## Session 6: Enhanced Nutrition API with USDA Integration (September 15, 2025)

### üéØ Session Goals
- Fix ingredient coverage issues ("√§gg" not found, "Kanelbulle-ugnsgr√∂t" 9/9 ingredients missing)
- Expand nutrition database beyond Livsmedelsverket's ~2,000 ingredients
- Implement cascading API system for better ingredient coverage

### üîß Major Implementation: Cascading API System

**Problem Identified**: Livsmedelsverket API has limited coverage (~2,000 Swedish ingredients)
- Common ingredients like "√§gg" (eggs) not found
- Recipe imports showing "Ingredienser utan n√§ringsdata: 9 varor"
- Users hitting ingredient lookup failures frequently

**Solution Implemented**: Multi-tier API cascade system
1. **Primary**: Livsmedelsverket (Swedish government database)
2. **Secondary**: USDA FoodData Central (350,000+ international ingredients)
3. **Fallback**: Mock data (existing system)

### üåê USDA FoodData Central Integration

**API Implementation**:
- Added `searchUSDAFood()` function in `netlify/functions/nutrition-lookup.js`
- Integrated with USDA API: `https://api.nal.usda.gov/fdc/v1/foods/search`
- Real-time nutrition data mapping: Energy, Protein, Carbs, Total lipid (fat)
- Normalized data format for frontend compatibility

**Translation System**:
- Created comprehensive Swedish‚ÜíEnglish ingredient dictionary (60+ mappings)
- Categories: proteins, grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy alternatives, baking ingredients, spices
- Smart matching: exact matches + partial matching for complex ingredients
- Examples: `√§gg ‚Üí eggs`, `havredryck vanilj ‚Üí oat milk vanilla`, `brun farin ‚Üí brown sugar`

### üìã Technical Implementation Details

**Files Modified**:
- `netlify/functions/nutrition-lookup.js` - Main API enhancement
- `netlify.toml` - Added API routing redirect
- Environment variable setup for secure API key storage

**API Flow**:
```
User input ‚Üí Livsmedelsverket API ‚Üí (if fails) ‚Üí Translate to English ‚Üí USDA API ‚Üí (if fails) ‚Üí Mock data
```

**Translation Dictionary Coverage**:
- Basic proteins: √§gg, kyckling, k√∂ttf√§rs, fisk, lax
- Grains/starches: ris, pasta, havregryn, quinoa
- Vegetables: tomat, l√∂k, spenat, frysta gr√∂nsaker
- Fruits: banan, √§pple, banan mogen
- Dairy alternatives: havredryck vanilj, kokosmj√∂lk
- Baking: bakpulver, brun farin, kanel, salt
- 60+ total mappings organized by category

### üß™ Testing Results

**Before Enhancement**:
- "√§gg" ‚Üí API failure ‚Üí Mock data fallback
- Kanelbulle-ugnsgr√∂t ‚Üí "Ingredienser utan n√§ringsdata: 9 varor"
- Limited to ~2,000 Swedish ingredients

**After Enhancement**:
- "√§gg" ‚Üí USDA: "Eggs, Grade A, Large" (155 kcal, 13g protein)
- "havredryck vanilj" ‚Üí USDA: "Oat milk, unsweetened, plain" (47 kcal, 0.8g protein)
- "banan mogen" ‚Üí USDA: "Bananas, ripe and slightly ripe, raw" (97 kcal, 0.7g protein)
- Expected: Kanelbulle-ugnsgr√∂t "Ingredienser utan n√§ringsdata: 0-2 varor"

### üîê Security Implementation

**Issue**: GitGuardian detected exposed API key in public repository
**Resolution**:
- Moved API key to environment variable (`process.env.USDA_API_KEY`)
- Added secure storage in Netlify environment variables
- Implemented fallback to DEMO_KEY for development

### üìä Performance & Coverage Impact

**Coverage Expansion**:
- From: ~2,000 Swedish ingredients (Livsmedelsverket only)
- To: ~2,000 Swedish + 350,000+ international ingredients (USDA)
- Dramatic reduction in "ingredient not found" errors

**API Rate Limits**:
- USDA DEMO_KEY: Very limited (hit during testing)
- Real USDA API key: 1,000 requests/hour
- Livsmedelsverket: No published limits

### üîÑ Current Status

**Deployed Features**:
- ‚úÖ Cascading API system (Livsmedelsverket ‚Üí USDA ‚Üí Mock)
- ‚úÖ Swedish‚ÜíEnglish translation dictionary (60+ ingredients)
- ‚úÖ USDA FoodData Central integration
- ‚úÖ API routing configuration (`/api/nutrition-lookup` ‚Üí Netlify function)
- ‚úÖ Environment variable security for API keys

**Pending Setup**:
- ‚è≥ USDA API key environment variable in Netlify dashboard
- ‚è≥ Production testing after environment variable deployment

### üí° Future Considerations & Next Session Ideas

**Potential Optimization**:
Consider switching to USDA-only approach with expanded translations instead of dual API system:

**Pros of USDA-Only Approach**:
- Simpler architecture (single API call)
- Faster response times (no cascading delays)
- Consistent data format
- Better international ingredient coverage
- No dependency on Livsmedelsverket availability

**Implementation Path**:
1. Expand Swedish‚ÜíEnglish translation dictionary significantly (200+ ingredients)
2. Add intelligent Swedish ingredient detection and translation
3. Remove Livsmedelsverket API dependency
4. Focus translation efforts on common Swedish cooking ingredients
5. Add caching layer for frequently looked-up ingredients

**Translation Dictionary Expansion Areas**:
- Regional Swedish ingredients and brands
- Cooking methods and preparations
- Common recipe terminology
- Meat cuts and seafood varieties
- Seasonal ingredients and preserved foods

### üîß Technical Debt & Improvements

**Current Limitations**:
- Translation dictionary requires manual maintenance
- No caching system (repeated API calls for same ingredients)
- Error handling could be more granular
- No user feedback for translation quality

**Potential Enhancements**:
- Implement Redis/local caching for nutrition lookups
- Add user-contributed translation suggestions
- Better error messages with suggested alternatives
- Analytics on most-searched missing ingredients

### Next Session Preparation
- **Environment Setup**: Complete USDA API key configuration in Netlify
- **Production Testing**: Validate full ingredient coverage in live app
- **Architecture Decision**: Evaluate USDA-only vs cascading approach
- **Translation Expansion**: Prepare comprehensive Swedish ingredient dictionary
- **Feature Development**: Ready to continue with Calorie Goal Calculator implementation

### Development Environment
- Working directory: `C:\Users\joelf\Portfolio webbsite`
- Project path: `projects/matladereknaren/`
- Git repository: Connected and synced
- API Integration: USDA FoodData Central + Livsmedelsverket cascading system
